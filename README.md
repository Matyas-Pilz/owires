Overhead wires is a mod by MatyasP, adds colorable overhead wires and masts and 
supports for it.
Mod is created for Advanced Trains railways (supports Advtrains Moreslopes) but
technically don't need AdvTrains.
For repaint of wires provides Repainter tool, for rotating provides Rotator tool
but you can use too screwdriver or WorldEdit. 
Using rotator: left click - rotating by 1
Using repainter: left click - change color by 1, right click - change color by 8

Actually isn't specific tool for simpliest or automated placing more of overhead
wires at once or replace wires by other type, for example left junction to right
junction. You can use only World Edit, Edit or similar tools for fill an area or 
copying nodes.

Colors: aren't used 10 latest colors in colorpalette - you can edit it and 
use colors own!
Why more colors? You can use it as "copper wires", "steel wires", you can use it
for planning the railways...
When you destroy some node, you will get to inventory with the same color.

Crafting: mod creator isn't good in survival. When somebody create and share 
crafting recipes, I will be happy!

KNOWED ISSUES:
1st) Mod creator has a procrastination for update and upgrade of
Noderoads and Nodehouses for a long time.
2nd) Last parts of longer slopes have invisible icon in inventory.
